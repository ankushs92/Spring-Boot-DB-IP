A stand alone app that integrates [Java-Db-IP](https://github.com/ankushs92/Java-DB-IP) with Spring Boot.
Detailed instructions can be found on [this blogpost](http://ankushs92.github.io/libraries/2016/05/12/java-db-ip.html)


# NOTE
This project is pretty old, not maintained. I would suggest you use [this](https://github.com/ankushs92/geolocation-useragent-parser-rest-api) library instead. It is event faster, and even gives out user agent analysis!
